My attempt at CyberSmart Tech test

Key Features:

    Handles Multiple users Todo List, on first page you will either 
    enter new account information which adds a new user or you'll select your account
    and enter the pin code you chose for the todo list

    When adding a new task on save it will send a request to the api along with the 
    city name to retrieve the current temperature then saves it with the location.

    Each task in the todo list will have a colour coded background correlated
    to the current local temperature

    Once a Task status has been marked as Done it is no longer editable
